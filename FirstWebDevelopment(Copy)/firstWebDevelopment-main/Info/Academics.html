DMC College Foundation, located in Dipolog City, Philippines, has a rich history dating back to 1974 when it was founded as a 
50-bed general hospital by 15 Dipolog citizens, including then Dipolog Archbishop Msgr. Felix Sanchez Zafra and 15 medical practitioners.
 The college started offering midwifery courses in 1977 and later expanded to offer nursing, physical therapy, radiologic technology, and medical 
 technology programs. In 1989, a new management team took over, and the college was renamed Dipolog Medical Center College of Health Sciences in 1991.
 The college continued to grow and expand its programs, including the addition of secondary education, computer science, criminology, and business courses.
